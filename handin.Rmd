red <- read.csv("Red.csv")
white <- read.csv("White.csv")
rose <- read.csv("Rose.csv")
sparkling <- read.csv("Sparkling.csv")

red$Type <- "Red"
white$Type <- "White"
rose$Type <- "Rose"
sparkling$Type <- "Sparkling"

data <- rbind(red, white, rose, sparkling) %>% select(-Name); head(data)
```

```{r}
cell_split <- initial_split(data, prop = 1/70, strata = "Type")

train_data <- training(cell_split)
test_data <- testing(cell_split);head(train_data);head(test_data)
